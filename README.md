# COVID19 Dashboard

## Introdution 
Hi everyone, This is a blog that I started as a pet-project, and I'm currently working on it alone.
At the moment, you can see a blog that implements tags, categories, news search and pagination. News is added via the admin panel. In the future, I want to add authorization, add posts through the site, and also add comments.
